"""/utxo/transfer must not move account-mirrored funds while dual-write is off.

`account_mirror_boxes` is the discriminator that says "this box IS this wallet's
account balance" (bounty #2819). `_settle_account_transfer_in_utxo` closes the
account->UTXO direction: an account confirm spends the sender's mirror box so the
same funds cannot move twice. Its docstring is explicit that it runs
"independent of UTXO_DUAL_WRITE: a migrated box must be reconciled whenever it
exists" -- i.e. in the default config the box and the balance are the same money.

The UTXO->account direction is unguarded. With dual_write off (the live default,
UTXO_DUAL_WRITE defaults to "0"), /utxo/transfer spends the mirror box via
apply_transaction and then skips every account-model write, so the sender keeps
a full account balance that no longer has a box behind it -- and walks away with
the box value too.

Fixtures follow tests/test_utxo_transfer_replay.py; the seed reproduces exactly
what node/utxo_genesis_migration.py:220-251 writes.
