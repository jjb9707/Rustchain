# Security Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-19

RustChain welcomes good-faith security research.

## Safe Harbor

If you act in good faith and follow this policy, Elyan Labs maintainers will not pursue legal action related to your research activities.

Good-faith means:

- avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- do not access, alter, or exfiltrate non-public user data
- do not move funds you do not own
- do not use social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks
- report vulnerabilities responsibly and give maintainers time to fix

## Authorization Statement

Testing conducted in accordance with this policy is authorized by project maintainers.
We will not assert anti-hacking claims for good-faith research that follows these rules.

## How to Report

Preferred:

- GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting. Use the **Report a vulnerability**
  button on this repository's Security tab. This is enabled and open to anyone.

Alternative, if you cannot reach GitHub or your tooling is blocked:

- Email **sophia.eagent@gmail.com**, the monitored project contact, with the
  affected component in the subject line.

Please do not send reports to addresses found in commit history. Several appear
there, they are personal accounts rather than project channels, and they are not
monitored as a security queue. A report sent to one can sit unread.

If your agent harness returns `403 Resource not accessible by integration` when
it tries to comment or open an issue, that is a limitation of your token rather
than a rejection, and it is explained here:
https://github.com/Scottcjn/rustchain-bounties/blob/main/docs/HOW_TO_SUBMIT_A_BOUNTY.md#if-you-cant-comment-403-resource-not-accessible-by-integration

Please include:

- affected component
- clear reproduction steps
- impact assessment
- suggested mitigation if available

## Scope

In scope:

- consensus and attestation logic
- reward calculation and epoch settlement
- wallet transfer and pending confirmation paths
- API authentication/authorization/rate-limit controls
- bridge and payout-related integrations

Out of scope:

- social engineering
- physical attacks
- denial-of-service against production infrastructure
- reports without reproducible evidence

## Response Targets

- acknowledgment: within 48 hours
- initial triage: within 5 business days
- fix/mitigation plan: within 30-45 days
- coordinated public disclosure target: up to 90 days

## Bounty Guidance (RTC)

Bounty rewards are discretionary and severity-based.

- Critical: 2000+ RTC
- High: 800-2000 RTC
- Medium: 300-800 RTC
- Low: 50-300 RTC

Bonuses may be granted for clear reproducibility, exploit reliability, and patch-quality remediation.

## Token Value and Compensation Disclaimer

- Bounty payouts are offered in project-native tokens unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- No token price, market value, liquidity, convertibility, or future appreciation is guaranteed.
- Participation in this open-source program is not an investment contract and does not create ownership rights.
- Rewards are recognition for accepted security work: respect earned through contribution.

## Prohibited Conduct

Reports are ineligible for reward if they involve:

- extortion or disclosure threats
- automated spam submissions
- duplicate reports without new technical substance
- exploitation beyond what is required to prove impact

## Recognition

Valid reports may receive:

- RTC bounty payout
- optional Hall of Hunters recognition
- follow-on hardening bounty invitations


## Payment-Authority Impersonation

**This appendix documents a contributor-protection abuse pattern. It does not make social-engineering reports bounty-eligible by itself.** Only the project-controlled RustChain payout flow can authorize RTC bounty disbursements. In practice, that means `@Scottcjn`, or a clearly labeled project automation account speaking on his behalf, with a matching project-issued pending transfer record. A comment from anyone else saying "I'll send the RTC," "payment is on the way," or similar is not a valid payout notice.

If you see a comment from anyone outside `@Scottcjn` / `sophiaeagent-beep` / `AutoJanitor` on a bounty issue saying things like:

- *"I'll send the X RTC to your wallet..."*
- *"Expect the payment within 24 hours..."*
- *"Transferring now..."*
- *"Here is the payment confirmation..."*

…on an issue where no authorized project-account comment has first authorized the payment, **treat it as a social-engineering attempt, not a legitimate bounty payout.** Account age, repo count, and unrelated prior commits are not equivalent to payment authority.

### Why this pattern matters

This attack does not need to steal funds. It creates a false expectation that the project promised payment and then failed to deliver, which can damage contributor trust in the real payout pipeline.

### What a real payment looks like

A legitimate RustChain bounty payout notice includes the amount, recipient wallet, and project-issued transfer identifiers needed for public verification, such as `pending_id`, `tx_hash`, and the confirmation timing (`confirms_at` / 24-hour window). If those identifiers are missing, or the comment is not from an authorized project account, do not treat it as payment confirmation.

### How to report an impersonation attempt

1. Tag `@Scottcjn` in a reply on the same issue.
2. Or open a private report via GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting on this repo.
3. Screenshot the impersonating comment — it may later be edited or deleted.

No retaliation against good-faith reporters. See Safe Harbor above.
